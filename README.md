The Spongy Moth (Lymantria dispar) deciduous forest infestation near the towns of Čelinac and Kotor Varoš in Bosnia and Herzegovina started in May, 2013 with a fully developed defoliation in second half of the June, which can be seen on both natural color RGB and color infrared NRG Landsat-8 satellite images on 20 June, 2013. The Landsat-8 satellite image on 22 July, 2013 shows that refoliation occurred, with light green color representing growth of new leaves. Different percent of the damage can be seen on the images on 20 June, 2013 with the 100% forest defoliation represented with brown colors in natural color RGB image and with green colors in color infrared NRG image.
